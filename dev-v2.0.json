The Rhine Gorge between R\u00fcdesheim am Rhein and Koblenz is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Near Sankt Goarshausen, the Rhine flows around the famous rock Lorelei. With its outstanding architectural monuments, the slopes full of vines, settlements crowded on the narrow river banks and scores of castles lined up along the top of the steep slopes, the Middle Rhine Valley can be considered the epitome of the Rhine romanticism."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What city has the biggest port in Germany?", "id": "572f7588947a6a140053c984", "answers": [{"text": "Duisburg", "answer_start": 321}, {"text": "Duisburg", "answer_start": 321}, {"text": "Duisburg", "answer_start": 321}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the Canal in Wesel?

After this number was placed into the authoritative Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die, it became generally accepted and found its way into numerous textbooks and official publications. The error was discovered in 2010, and the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat confirms the length at 1,232 kilometres (766 miles).[note 1]"}]}]}
